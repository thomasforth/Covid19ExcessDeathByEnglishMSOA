# IMDByMSOA
English Indices of Multiple Deprivation Score and Decile for MSOAs

## What is this?
People in England like to use Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMDs) to classify areas. IMDs are published by LSOA. But I wanted them in another, bigger, geography, the MSOA. So I wrote some code to calculate them. And I'm sharing the answer.

## Are these right?
They're probably quite close. I'm not sure how [Alasdair and I have got different answers](https://twitter.com/thomasforth/status/1257086421539618816), but our answers are close enough.

## What raw data are you using.
Check out the source code. It's called Program.cs because I'm not the kind of person who bothers to change the defaults in Visual Studio. Yeah, the code is in C# .Net Core. Sorry, I suppose, I just don't really like R. Or Python.

## License
Use my code for whatever you like. MIT licence, or whatever else you like. Seriously, steal it if you like and never give me credit, I don't care. But it would be nice.

But I'm also sharing raw data, and that's almost certainly Open Government Licence. I think we're safe from the dreaded Royal Mail, but you probably want to check before creating your megabucks startup.
