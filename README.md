# IMDByMSOA
English Indices of Multiple Deprivation Score and Decile for MSOAs

## What is this?
People in England like to use Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMDs) to classify areas. IMDs are published by LSOA. But I wanted them in another, bigger, geography, the MSOA. So I wrote some code to calculate them. And I'm sharing the answer.

## Are these right?
They're probably quite close. I'm not sure how [Alasdair and I have got different answers](https://twitter.com/thomasforth/status/1257086421539618816), but our answers are close enough.

## License
Use my code for whatever you like. MIT licence, or whatever else you like. Seriously, steal it if you like and never give me credit, I don't care. But it would be nice.

But I'm also sharing raw data, and that's almost certainly Open Government Licence. I think we're safe from the dreaded Royal Mail, but you probably want to check before creating your megabucks startup.
